# Betterment: Fintech Case Study

## Overview and Origin 

Name of Company:  Betterment

Incorporated in 2008

Founders: Eli Broverman, Jon Stein

The idea for the company arose after the two founders, Eli and Jon, opened a restaurant together in New York City in 2007 while Jon was attending school at Columbia University.  This initial business arrangement led them to understand that they shared the same investing philosophy as Jon Stein states "passive, goal-based, and automatic investing philosophy."  The idea to create Betterment stemmed from Jon's own experience and the idea that human emotion dictates most of investment decisions.  He states, "While economics is good at explaining the world at a macro level, it fails to explain human behavior. At a micro level, economics assumes that humans are rational, and they’re far from rational. Especially when it comes to their money; people heavily discount the future, they withdraw when markets crash, and it’s because our emotions drive our decisions." The most common bad behaviors he wanted to address were: constantly monitoring accounts, trying to time the market, and inefficient trading (loss of time, tax implications, and transaction costs).  As he progressed this idea, the realization that automation of investments would save people from themselves.  He finally concluded that to do this he had to build this from the ground up.

Betterment has to date raised funding through a total of 7 rounds of funding.  According to crunchbase.com, the total amount of funding is approximately $275 million.  The last round of funding was thru the secondary markets in 2017.

## Business Activities:

Betterment mission is to create a platform for everyday investors struggling to manage their own investments.  Due to the lack of financial education for most individuals and overall fear of the unknown, Betterment seeks to offer a simple, secure service that anyone can use and uses proven long term, passive investing strategies to offer net positive outcomes at a low fee in relation to the overall personal investing space. Betterment's intended customer base is the new investor or investor looking for long term goals with minimal work.  They provide a investment advice, banking services, and operate as a fiduciary for their customers.  The company is regulated by FINRA and the SEC and is licensed to operate as a Broker-Dealer.

At the end of 2019, the market size was estimated at 300 billion dollars AUM (Assets Under Management). The current market size for Robo-Advisory Services is esitmated to be around 1 trillionsdollars AUM. 

There entire portfolio management is based on Modern Stock Theory and follows their proprietary algorithm.  Completely automated process for the customer.  They utilize Tax Loss Harvesting and automatically rebalance portfolios when performance exceeds specific limits.

## Landscape

Personal Investing is vast industry.  There are so many options and more keep coming. Active investing has long held the majority of assets invested, but the passive, robo-advisory sector has grown substantially since its inception.  

Overtime Betterment has grown from a simple equity/bond investment vehicle.  It now offers cash management, banking (savings/checking), retirement accounts, and Personal Trusts.  They also offer 401k support for employers.

As far as competitors, there main competitors are Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Personal Capital, and Wealthfront.  

## Results

Betterment was a pioneer in this space.  The growth of RoboAdvisors has been significant.  Initially, Betterment took majority of the market share, but over time as older, more established companies offered similar platforms, like Vanguard and Charles Schwab, they have fallen to number 3 in AUM at 18.1 billion dollars.

## Recommendations

As of right now, allocations from the company only offer exposure to equities and bonds.  The company would greatly benefit from adding exposure to Real Estate in the form of REITS and also should consider adding cryptocurrency exposure.  These two products would give the company a larger pool of investors who seek this exposure and with the rapid rate of growth in these two sectors offer great value to their portfolios.  

Since the core business model revolves around algorithms, investment into the AI space would greatly help them in the future.  This way the company stays up to date with the advancements in the AI space and in turn create extra value when there are large amounts of volatility.  This will take time to curate and evolve over their base protocol but in time it would create a large cost savings in terms of labor and allow them to continue provide a great service but lower the overall cost of running their business.
